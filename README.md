#Caesar Cipher Tool 🔐

This project is a simple Caesar Cipher Tool built during my internship at Prodigy InfoTech. It’s designed to encrypt and decrypt messages using the classic Caesar Cipher technique.

#Project Overview 🚀

The Caesar Cipher is one of the oldest encryption techniques where each letter in the plaintext is shifted by a certain number of positions in the alphabet. This tool allows users to:

Encrypt: Convert plaintext into ciphertext by shifting letters by a given key.

Decrypt: Reverse the process and retrieve the original message.


Features ✨
User-friendly interface to easily encrypt or decrypt text.
Allows custom shift keys for flexibility.
Built with simplicity and efficiency in mind for quick demonstrations of basic encryption concepts.
Technologies Used 🛠️
Language: Python 🐍
IDE: Visual Studio Code 💻


How to Use ⚙️
Clone the repository:
open cmd or bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/caesar-cipher-tool.git

Navigate to the project directory:
cd caesar-cipher-tool

Run the Python script:
python caesar_cipher.py
Customization Options 🎛️
Shift Key: You can modify the shift key value in the script or input it when prompted.
Message: Input your own message to either encrypt or decrypt.
